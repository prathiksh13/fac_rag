"""Typed application settings.

Every tunable in the engine is declared here exactly once and read through
`get_settings()`. Nothing else in the codebase calls `os.environ` directly,
which keeps configuration auditable and makes the whole system describable
from a single object.

Values are resolved with this precedence (highest wins):

1. Explicit constructor arguments
2. Process environment variables (prefix `FR_`, groups nested with `__`)
3. The `.env` file at the project root
4. The defaults declared on each settings class
